# Interview
This Xcode project is a 2 master -> detail views. 

The view shown after pressing "Contacts" should be UITableView of Contact objects. These Contact objects are populated from a mock REST service denoted in the project. Upon selecting a row in the list of contacts, a detail view will be pushed on to the navigation stack which displays detailed information about the selected Contact object.

The view shown after pressing "Fibonacci" should be a UITableView which displays the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, one per UITableView row. Scrolling the UITableView should be as efficient as possible.
